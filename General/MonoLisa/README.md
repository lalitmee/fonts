# MonoLisa - Font follows function

Congratulations for purchasing MonoLisa. I hope you have as much fun using it as we had creating the typeface.

## Installation

The typeface is distributed in TTF format as **variable** and **separate weights**. The exact variable range depends on your version (personal, plus, pro). The way how to install, depends on your editor:

* **JetBrains** products need **separate font files** to work correctly so copy the files from the `ttf` directory to your system. You can copy `variable` as well as it won't conflict. It turns out that in this case, JetBrains uses the separate weight version to populate their font weights but will point to the assets from the variable version so both can exist within a system.
* For any other case, you copy `variable` only. Especially VS Code is known to work well.

[Please see the FAQ online](https://www.monolisa.dev/faq#how-to-install-the-typeface) for more specific instructions and information.

## Nerd Fonts

If you use [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), the professional edition includes an already patched version at the `nerdfonts` directory.

For other editions, it's easy to patch the typeface using [nerdfonts/patcher](https://hub.docker.com/r/nerdfonts/patcher) with Docker.

## Customization

Depending on the version you bought, you may have access to the customize tool available online. You can [find it at your orders page](https://www.monolisa.dev/orders).

The customize tool lets you alter the typeface to your liking. It also gives access to other formats, not just ttf, should you need them.
